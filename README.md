# 📚 Project Latih

> **Latih** *(Bahasa Melayu)* — to practise, to train, to drill.  
> A name that means exactly what it does.

## What is Latih?

**Latih** is a free, offline-capable web application that gives primary school children a simple, distraction-free place to practise their homework and exercises.

Every question follows the **KSSR (Kurikulum Standard Sekolah Rendah)** format — the same structure used in Malaysian primary school assessments. Parents do not need to install anything. Teachers do not need a server. Students open a browser and start working.

Latih runs entirely in the browser. There is no backend, no database server, and no monthly fee. All data is stored locally on the device.

---

## Why Latih Exists

Malaysian primary school children (Year 1–6) need consistent, low-friction daily practice. Existing platforms are either:

- Too complex for young children to navigate independently
- Require paid subscriptions or internet connections
- Not aligned to the local curriculum format

Latih is built to be the opposite: simple enough for a 9-year-old to use alone, available offline, and completely free to host on GitHub Pages.

---

## Core Aims

1. **Provide daily homework practice** aligned to KSSR primary school subjects
2. **Remove barriers** — no login required for students, no internet required after first load
3. **Support multiple children** on the same device with separate profiles and grade tracking
4. **Make question authoring easy** — teachers and parents write questions in plain Markdown, no coding needed
5. **Give children immediate, honest feedback** — correct/wrong shown instantly with sound cues
6. **Track progress over time** — simple grade history and charts visible to the child and parent

## Paper Format

Each paper lives in its own folder under `/papers/`. Three files per paper:

### `question.md` — what the student sees

Written in plain Markdown. Question type and marks declared inline. Answer key lines start with `**JAWAPAN**:` and are stripped before display.

```markdown
---
title: Matematik Tahun 4 — Ujian Pecahan
subject: Matematik
year: 4
duration: 30
total_marks: 10

```

### `answers.json` — structured answer key (generated from `question.md`)

```json
{
  "paper_id": "matematik-tahun4-pecahan",
  "questions": [
    { "id": "S1", "type": "mcq",   "correct": "B",  "marks": 2 },
    { "id": "S2", "type": "fill",  "correct": "15", "marks": 2 },
    { "id": "S3", "type": "short", "correct": "8",  "marks": 2 }
  ]
}
```

### `rubric.json` — paper metadata

```json
{
  "paper_id": "matematik-tahun4-pecahan",
  "title": "Matematik Tahun 4 — Ujian Pecahan",
  "subject": "Matematik",
  "year": 4,
  "duration_minutes": 30,
  "total_marks": 10,
  "difficulty": "sederhana",
  "tags": ["pecahan", "bahagian", "KSSR"],
  "created": "2026-03-24",
  "author": "Cikgu Haru"
}
```

## localStorage Data Schema

All user data is stored in the browser's `localStorage`. No data leaves the device.

```
latih_users          → { user_001: { name, school, year, avatar_color }, ... }
latih_session        → { current_user: "user_001" }
latih_grades_001     → [ { paper_id, date, score, max, time_taken_s, answers }, ... ]
latih_kanban_001     → { todo: [...], doing: [...], done: [...] }
latih_memos_001      → [ { id, text, pinned, created }, ... ]
latih_reminders_001  → [ { id, text, time, days: ["Monday","Wednesday"] }, ... ]
latih_timetable_001  → { Monday: ["BM","Math"], Tuesday: [...], ... }
```

`001` is replaced by the actual user ID for each user.

---

## How to Add a New Paper

1. Create a new folder inside `/papers/` — name it clearly, e.g. `sains-tahun5-fotosintesis`
2. Copy the three files from `/papers/_template/`
3. Write the questions in `question.md` using the format shown above
4. Fill in `answers.json` and `rubric.json`
5. Commit and push to GitHub — the paper appears in Latih automatically

**Tip:** You can ask Antigravity (Claude) to generate a complete paper for you. Just describe the topic, year group, number of questions, and question types. Antigravity will produce all three files ready to copy-paste.

Example prompt for Antigravity:
> "Generate a Latih paper for Matematik Tahun 3, topic: Nombor Bulat, 5 MCQ questions worth 1 mark each and 3 fill-in-the-blank worth 2 marks each. Output question.md, answers.json, and rubric.json."

---

## Grading Scale

| Percentage | Grade | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 90 – 100% | A+ | Cemerlang |
| 80 – 89%  | A  | Cemerlang |
| 70 – 79%  | B  | Kepujian |
| 60 – 69%  | C  | Lulus |
| 50 – 59%  | D  | Lulus |
| Below 50% | E  | Perlu Usaha |

---

## Development Approach

Latih is built to be **maintained without coding expertise**. All feature development and bug fixes are handled through **Antigravity (Claude)**:

1. Describe what you want to change or add in plain language
2. Antigravity generates the updated HTML/CSS/JS
3. Copy the output into the correct file
4. Commit to GitHub

No npm. No build pipeline. No terminal commands beyond `git push`.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Paper engine: Markdown render + answer capture + scoring | ✅ Prototype done |
| Phase 2 | Multi-user login + localStorage persistence + profile | 🔲 Next |
| Phase 3 | Grade history + Chart.js dashboard | 🔲 Planned |
| Phase 4 | Kanban + reminders + memo | 🔲 Planned |
| Phase 5 | Offline Service Worker + mobile layout + PWA install | 🔲 Planned |
| Phase 6 | Paper browser UI + difficulty filter + subject filter | 🔲 Planned |

---

## Contributing

Latih is an open project. Contributions welcome:

- **New papers** — write a paper for any KSSR subject and submit a pull request
- **Bug reports** — open a GitHub Issue with steps to reproduce
- **Feature ideas** — open a GitHub Discussion

All question content must be appropriate for primary school children (Year 1–6) and aligned to the Malaysian KSSR curriculum.
